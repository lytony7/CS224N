Overall Evaluation
To evaluate a poem generator, assign scores (1-3) for each of the four categories (Fluency, Coherence, Meaning, Aesthetics). The final score can be an average or a weighted sum based on the importance of each category.

Example:

Fluency: 2
Coherence: 3
Meaning: 2
Aesthetics: 3
Overall Score: (2 + 3 + 2 + 3) / 4 = 2.5

This simplified rubric provides a structured yet straightforward evaluation method for poem generators.
